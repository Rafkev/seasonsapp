# seasonsapp
A Web Application that tells the season in UK (Winter, Summer or Spring)
To determine the season in the UK, we can use the current month to make a general estimation. Of course, this won't be perfectly accurate, but it can give us a rough idea based on typical seasonal patterns. Here's a Python program to do that. To however, make this application close to being acurate we need to add some validation checks.

This can be used by student, children who can't really tell what the seasons are. So, the Appliccation, speaks out the output via text to speech and tells the child, we are in winter, for instance and tell him/her the reasons.

This Web Application was created using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. I'll add an HTML template with CSS styling and JavaScript functionality to make it more user-friendly.

Instrucctions
First, I installed Flask 
Now, I created the project structure check the arduino file.

When you run app.py and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser, you'll see a styled webpage displaying the current season in the UK. Feel free to add more features or customize the design further!
